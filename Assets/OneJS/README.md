> `onejs-v2` has achieved feature parity with V1, supporting Preact, Tailwind, Styled, and Emotion out of the box. So feel free to give it a try. We are currently polishing some custom Editors and working on documentation and demos for v2. Please join our Discord to get help or give feedback. https://discord.gg/dwnYFte6SF

In most cases, you can just clone this repo directly under your Assets folder. If you encounter any issue when upgrading OneJS, you can try deleting `ScriptLib/` folder and `tsconfig.json` in your OneJS Working Directory. They will be automatically regenerated.
